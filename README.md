# Chat Application

This is a java based chat application. To run it simply do the following:
* Install Java.
* Run the `Server.java` file.
* If you wish to run the app locally, you can simply run the `Connection.java` file normally.
* Otherwise, simply open up the `Connection.java` file, and at the top where you see the arrow you can change the `"localhost"` text to read the INET IP of your server. Then you can run the Chat App from anywhere and it will automatically connect to your desired host.
